Guide a campaign transition — from the current campaign (e.g. Strahd) to the new homebrew world.

Do not begin this flow until the DM explicitly confirms the transition is happening. Ask one clarifying question at a time. Do not write anything without confirmation at each step.

---

## Phase 1 — Confirm and Name

Ask:
1. "Confirmed — are we doing the transition now, or just planning ahead?"
2. If now: "What's the name of the new world or campaign? (Can be a placeholder if unnamed yet.)"

Wait for answers before continuing.

---

## Phase 2 — Audit What Crosses Over

Read `historian/characters/pcs/` — list all PCs and companions. Ask the DM:

> "These characters are crossing over to the new world. Anyone staying behind, dying in the transition, or getting left in Strahd?"

Also ask:

> "Any Strahd-era NPCs, items, or factions explicitly coming with the party? List them and I'll update their tags."

Wait for the DM's response. Note which entities cross over vs. stay Strahd-tagged.

---

## Phase 3 — Update Tags

For each entity confirmed as crossing over:
- Remove `campaign: strahd` and replace with `campaign: <new-name>` (or remove tag entirely if campaign-agnostic)

For each entity staying behind:
- Leave `campaign: strahd` unchanged

For the party PCs and companions confirmed as crossing: update their historian files now. Show the DM the list of changes before writing.

---

## Phase 4 — Update Campaign File

Campaign files live in `scheduler/campaign/` — one per campaign. Read both the concluding campaign file (`state: active`) and the successor file (`state: draft`). Propose updates:
- Concluding campaign: `state` → `completed` and `active` → `false`, then move to `historian/campaign/` (create the folder on first use — read `meta/graph-settings.md` before adding it, and work with Kellan to fill the historian-side fields as he starts using them)
- Successor campaign: `state` → `active` and `active` → `true` (both fields must flip — scripts key on `state`, but the `active` boolean exists in the frontmatter and must not contradict it)
- Successor `description` → brief new world premise (ask DM for 1–2 sentences)
- Successor `tone`, `themes` → ask if these are changing or carrying over. **Tone reset:** before writing these, read `meta/worldbuilding.md`'s "What to Avoid" list — it explicitly forbids gothic horror bleeding forward (Strahd is a chapter, not the world's identity). Check the proposed tone/themes against every avoid-list item and flag any carry-over that violates one.
- Reset or archive active act/mission references

Do not write until DM approves the proposed content.

---

## Phase 5 — Scaffold New Act

Create a new Act 1 placeholder in `scheduler/acts/` for the new campaign. Use the same placeholder structure as the Strahd Act 1, with fields for Kellan to fill in:
- `central_conflict: TBD`
- `goal: TBD`
- `opening_state: TBD`
- `closing_state: TBD`

Ask the DM: "Should I create the new Act 1 scaffold now, or wait until Kellan is ready to fill it in?"

---

## Phase 6 — Index and Wrap Up

After all file changes are confirmed and written:
1. Remind the DM to rebuild the semantic index: `uv run scripts/index-entities.py`
2. Summarize what changed: entities retagged, campaign file updated, new act scaffolded
3. Note any Strahd entities the DM flagged as potential crossovers but left unresolved — list them as open items

---

**Throughout:** Never write silently. Each phase ends with a confirmation before the next begins. The DM may pause mid-transition and resume later — that's fine.
